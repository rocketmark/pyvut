# 6DoF tracking with the VIVE Ultimate Tracker on Ubuntu without an HMD

This guide shows how to capture full 6DoF poses from HTC's VIVE Ultimate Trackers on Ubuntu using USB HID or the wireless dongle without owning the Vive HMD (Head Mounted Display).

**Acknowledgement:** This fork builds upon [`vive_ultimate_tracker_re`](https://github.com/shinyquagsire23/vive_ultimate_tracker_re) reverse-engineering work.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** at least one VIVE Ultimate Tracker; optional wireless dongle (preferred for multi-tracker work) or direct USB connection. Host PC must be able to talk to HID devices and, for map resets, provide `adb` access.

### Constructing map (SteamVR / VIVE) - only available on Windows

Do the initial SLAM map construction on Windows with SteamVR + VIVE Streaming Hub; after the tracker stores the map, you can return to Ubuntu for everything else in this guide.

1. Install SteamVR.
2. Enable the SteamVR "null driver" (virtual headset) using [SteamVRNoHeadset](https://github.com/username223/SteamVRNoHeadset).
3. Install the VIVE Streaming Hub from HTC's site.
4. Follow the VIVE Streaming Hub instructions to create a new map; you can ignore the final step that asks for a SteamVR headset connection.
5. Once your trackers indicate they are "ready" in Streaming Hub, verify any additional requirements from the sections below (Wi-Fi config, dongle pairing, etc.).

### Software & configuration

- Python 3.x plus the `hid`, `numpy`, and `pygame` packages (`pip install hid numpy pygame`).
- HID dependency note: this code imports `hid` (not `hidapi`). On Debian/Ubuntu install `libhidapi-hidraw0` and `libhidapi-libusb0` (e.g., `sudo apt install libhidapi-hidraw0 libhidapi-libusb0`) before `pip install hid` so the native bindings build.
- Permissions: Ubuntu users may need udev rules so HID devices are accessible without `sudo`; for quick tests you can run `sudo chmod a+r /dev/hidraw${NUM}` on the device path printed by `hid_test.py` or `rf_hid_test.py`.
- Wi-Fi setup: edit `pyvut/wifi_info.json` with the SSID, password, country, and frequency you want the SLAM host tracker to broadcast; this step is required when you operate multiple trackers so they can sync over the host AP.

## Quick Start Cheatsheet

### Direct USB tracker (`hid_test.py`)
1. Plug a tracker directly over USB.
2. `python hid_test.py` enumerates HID interface 0, configures camera policy/FPS, and requests PCVR power (`set_power_pcvr(1)`).
3. Uncomment the loop at the bottom to continuously parse incoming pose packets (`while True: parse_incoming(); kick_watchdog()`).

### Wireless dongle (`rf_hid_test.py`)
1. Plug the wireless dongle into the host PC.
2. `python rf_hid_test.py` enumerates the dongle, issues safe queries (fusion mode, role ID, IDs/SN, ROM version, capability dumps), and prints responses.
3. Example RF control and pairing helpers live near the bottom (e.g., `send_rf_command(0x1D, ...)`). Avoid flash/write opcodes unless you are prepared for risky behavior.

### pyvut package (`pyvut/`)
1. Update Wi-Fi credentials in `pyvut/wifi_info.json`.
2. Pair trackers with the dongle; the pyvut helper auto-selects the first tracker as SLAM host.
3. `python pyvut/tracker_core.py` streams ACK/status traffic, auto-sends SLAM role and Wi-Fi ACKs, and keeps pose state for up to five trackers.
4. `python scripts/visualize_pygame.py` renders simple 3D markers for live position/orientation; close the window to exit.

## Install as a Package

The repository now ships as a standard Python package. Install it into a virtual environment (editable mode recommended while hacking):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[visualizer]
```

The core dependencies are `hid` and `numpy`; the optional `visualizer` extra pulls in `pygame` for `scripts/visualize_pygame.py`.

## Python API for 6DoF Poses

Import `pyvut.UltimateTrackerAPI` to receive tracker poses (position + quaternion rotation + acceleration) through callbacks or polling. The API reuses the existing HID plumbing and exposes each pose as a `TrackerPose` dataclass.

```python
import time
from pyvut import TrackerPose, UltimateTrackerAPI


def on_pose(pose: TrackerPose) -> None:
	print(
		f"Tracker {pose.tracker_index} @ {pose.mac}: "
		f"pos={pose.position} rot={pose.rotation} tracking={pose.tracking_status}"
	)


with UltimateTrackerAPI(mode="DONGLE_USB") as api:
	api.add_pose_callback(on_pose)
	while True:
		time.sleep(1)
```

- `UltimateTrackerAPI` supports both dongle (`mode="DONGLE_USB"`) and direct USB tracker (`mode="TRACKER_USB"`) paths.
- Use `api.get_latest_pose(idx)` to fetch the current pose for a tracker without registering callbacks.
- Provide a custom Wi-Fi config via `UltimateTrackerAPI(..., wifi_info_path="/path/to/wifi_info.json")` if you do not want to edit the packaged default.
- Prefer a quick CLI demo? Run `python scripts/stream_poses.py --mode DONGLE_USB` to print live pose samples.

## Repository Map

- `hid_test.py`: minimal direct-USB HID pokes; bring up PCVR mode, send haptics, parse pose packets.
- `rf_hid_test.py`: experimental HID access to the wireless dongle; includes many RF/dongle command IDs plus hardware queries.
- `pyvut/`: higher-level helpers and enums for HID/RF communication.
	- `tracker_core.py`: `DongleHID`, `TrackerHID`, and `ViveTrackerGroup` abstractions for pairing, SLAM role assignment, Wi-Fi ACKs, and pose tracking.
	- `clear_maps.sh`: adb helper to wipe `/data/lambda` and `/data/mapdata` on a tracker.
	- `enums_*.py`: command and response constants (USB HID, RF, Wi-Fi, status, ACKs, dongle commands).
- `scripts/visualize_pygame.py`: lightweight pygame visualizer for up to 5 trackers.
- `scripts/stream_poses.py`: CLI demo that prints pose samples via `UltimateTrackerAPI`.
- `ota_parse.py`: extracts and CRC-checks partitions from HTC OTA firmware images (`trackers/firmware/TX_FW.ota`).
- `how-to-use.md`: this README distilled version; keep it handy for detailed background.

## Script Highlights

### Direct USB helpers (`hid_test.py`)
- `set_tracking_mode(mode)`: toggle between gyro and SLAM modes (IDs defined in `pyvut/enums_horusd_status.py`).
- `send_haptic(...)`: trigger haptics on the connected tracker.
- `parse_pose_data(...)`: decode position, rotation, and acceleration from raw HID packets.

### Wireless dongle experiments (`rf_hid_test.py`)
- Enumerates dongle HID endpoints, queries role IDs, SNs, ROM versions, and capability bitfields.
- Includes example pairing (`send_rf_command(0x1D, ...)`) and control commands for trackers.
- `fuzz_blacklist` and inline comments flag dangerous opcodes—respect them.

### pyvut helpers (`pyvut/`)
- `DongleHID` pairs trackers, assigns SLAM host/role, forwards ACKs, and maintains Wi-Fi credentials.
- `TrackerHID` offers a direct USB transport option (`ViveTrackerGroup(mode="TRACKER_USB")`).
- `ViveTrackerGroup` keeps arrays of poses and exposes `get_pos(idx)`/`get_rot(idx)` for consumers.
- SLAM/map helpers react to ACKs (`ACK_MAP_STATUS`, `ACK_LAMBDA_STATUS`, etc.) by requesting or ending maps when trackers get stuck.

## OTA Parsing (`ota_parse.py`)

1. Place `trackers/firmware/TX_FW.ota` in the repo.
2. Run `python ota_parse.py`.
3. The script lists OTA segments, validates HTC's CRC-128, and dumps each segment as `seg_<index>_<mem_addr>.bin` for further inspection.

## Tips, Caveats, and Safety

- HID interface numbers are currently hard-coded (interface 0 for HID1); if enumeration fails, inspect `hid.enumerate(...)` output for the right path.
- Many command IDs were inferred from binaries or experimentation; logging dumps raw payloads to help future reverse engineering.
- Several dongle commands reboot or brick hardware. Review `DCMDS_THAT_RESTART` / `DCMDS_THAT_WRITE_FLASH` in `pyvut/enums_horusd_dongle.py` before experimenting.
- Scripts often run tight loops without throttling; sprinkle `time.sleep(...)` if USB polling needs to be kinder to your system.
- `clear_maps.sh` wipes tracker-side SLAM data via `adb shell`; handy when map state gets wedged.
